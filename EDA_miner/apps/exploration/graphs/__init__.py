Developer notes:

Some suggestions on what could be done here:
    - Define more PDF report layouts (see also `layouts.py`).
    - Add more graph types in any of the categories (but avoid word \
      vector visualizations).
    - Add additional functionality in KPIs.
    - Improve baseline graph and/or function.
    - Improve network visualizations.
