<h2>Developer notes</h2>

The modules here are for implementing utilities needed by higher-level
modules. Some suggestions on what could be done:
<ul>
    <li>Add new API connections (note: you need to implement both
    the connector and define a layout/form).</li>
    <li>Fix the bug that made me pollute the whole file with those
    ugly debugger layouts.</li>
</ul>
